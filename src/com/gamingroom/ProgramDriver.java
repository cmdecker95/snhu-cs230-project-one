   * The main method serves as the entry point for the application. It
   * demonstrates the use of the singleton pattern by obtaining a reference to the
   * singleton instance of GameService and initializing some game data. The
   * singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a
   * global point of access to it. This is useful in this application to ensure
   * that there is only one instance of GameService managing the game data. Steps
   * performed in this method: 1. Obtain reference to the singleton instance of
   * GameService. 2. Print a message indicating the start of game data
   * initialization. 3. Add two games to the GameService and print their details.
   * 4. Use another class (SingletonTester) to verify that only one instance of
   * GameService exists.
