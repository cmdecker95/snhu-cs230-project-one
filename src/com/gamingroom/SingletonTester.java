/**
 * The SingletonTester class is designed to test the singleton pattern
 * implementation of the GameService class. The singleton pattern ensures that a
 * class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This
 * is useful in scenarios where exactly one object is needed to coordinate
 * actions across the system. In this application, the GameService class is
 * implemented as a singleton to manage the collection of games. This ensures
 * that there is only one instance of GameService throughout the application,
 * providing a consistent and centralized way to access and manage the games.
 * The testSingleton method demonstrates how to obtain the singleton instance of
 * GameService and interact with it by printing the list of games.
