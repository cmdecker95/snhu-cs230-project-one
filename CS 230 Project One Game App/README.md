This Java application is a web-based game called "Draw It or Lose It". The game is a drawing and guessing game where teams take turns solving a puzzle by guessing what phrase, title, or thing is being depicted by images as they render to the screen. Each puzzle has a set of clues, which are the images, which load one-by-one over the first 30 seconds of the round. If the puzzle isn't solved in 30 seconds, the number of possible points goes from 2 to 1, and the team still has 30 more seconds to solve the puzzle. If the puzzle isn't solved in 60 seconds, the other teams have 15 additional seconds to simultaneously guess the puzzle. If no team guesses the puzzle, the round ends and no points are awarded. The game is played in a series of 4 rounds, and the team with the most points at the end of the game wins.

## Quick Start

To run the game, install Java 17 or later and run:

```bash
